#Apple Website Mockup  

#Description  

Congratulations, you've made it to the fifth round of your interviews for Apple! You've made a great impression on everybody and Tim Cook has personally emailed you with your next step; a CSS styling project! He is not looking for a pixel perfect replica, but he wants to make sure that you can capture the general layout of the page.

#Instructions  

Without modifying the given HTML document, style it to match the 'Apple website' mockup.
Apply a background image to the 'site-header'. The image is found in the 'img' file.

#Icons
You might have noticed some interesting < i > tags in the markup. We have implemented some cool 'font-awesome' icons in this project. Head over to fontawesome.io to learn more. We've not covered these in a lesson before, but we've already done the heavy lifting for you, so all you need to do is to move them into place. Also note that you can apply size and color to the font icons, since they are a indeed a font.

#Hint  

The width of the mockup is 1280px.
One way of approaching styling is to start from the very top, working your way down.
